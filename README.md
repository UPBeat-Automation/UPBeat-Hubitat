![GitHub Downloads (all assets, all releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/UPBeat-Automation/UPBeat-Hubitat/total)

The Universal Powerline Bus (UPB) is a communication protocol used for home automation and building control. It enables devices to communicate over the existing powerline infrastructure, eliminating the need for additional wiring. UPB is a robust, reliable, and scalable technology designed for applications such as lighting control, HVAC management, and appliance integration. Through testing, field trials, and residential installations, UPB has been proven to be greater than 99.9% reliable.

The Universal Powerline Bus (UPB) Hubitat Integration allows you to control your UPB devices via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit.

## Installing Ser2Net for Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi

1. Raspbian (Raspberry Pi OS Lite) [Installing Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)
2. Once installed, use apt to install Ser2Net, you should be able to cut and paste the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ser2net
```

3. As root, using a text editor, modify the /etc/ser2net.yaml. The only entry that is needed in the full file is shown below.
   
#### Raspberry Pi example with Pulseworx PIM-U Powerline Interface Module:
```yaml
%YAML 1.1
---
# This is a ser2net configuration file, tailored to be rather
# simple.
#
# Find detailed documentation in ser2net.yaml(5)
# A fully featured configuration file is in
# /usr/share/doc/ser2net/examples/ser2net.yaml.gz
#
# If you find your configuration more useful than this very simple
# one, please submit it as a bugreport

connection: &UPBPIM
    accepter: tcp,4999
    enable: on
    options:
      kickolduser: true
      telnet-brk-on-sync: false
    connector: serialdev,
              /dev/ttyUSB0,
              4800n81,local
```

4. Once you have saved the changes to the /etc/ser2net.yaml file you will need to restart the ser2net service. Using the following commands.
```
sudo service ser2net stop
sudo service ser2net start
```

5. Check the service status using `sudo service ser2net status` you should see somthing like shown below.

## Driver Notes

The primary drivers needed for most UPB deployments are `UPB Scene Switch`, `UPB Dimming Switch`, and `UPB Non-Dimming Switch` but other experimental drivers exist.

The virtual `UPB Multi-Speed Fan Driver`, `UPB Single-Speed Fan Driver` and `UPB Actuator Driver` work in hubitat but are not fully tested against Alexa, Google, and Apple home assistants. 

This is a current area of testing and development. You can change the driver associated with the respective device types from the device info view.

## Limitations

The UPBeat UI is able to parse the complete UPE file, however; some device types are not currently supported, please see the list below for more information: 

**Note: Any devices which trigger scenes will be propagated to show the correct device states. Also multi-channel devices are supported currently by creating a device per channel. In the future, parent and child devices may be used to reflect a parent device and child channels.**

- 0 = Other (Unsupported)
- 1 = Keypad (Partial) - Keypads scene triggers will be propagated to show the correct device states.
- 2 = Switch (On/Off/Dim/Status)
- 3 = Module (On/Off/Dim/Status)
- 4 = Input Module (Unsupported)
- 5 = Input-Output Module (Unsupported)
- 6 = VPM (Unsupported)
- 7 = VHC (Unsupported)
- 8 = Thermostat (Unsupported)
- 9 = XPW (Unsupported)
- 10 = RFI (Unsupported)

We hope to grow device support with the help of the community and other developers.
